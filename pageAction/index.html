	This extentsion aims to protect your privcy on websites that only offer limited or no choices for declining cookies from third parties.
	In particular, it blogs third party plug-ins on websites that are visted so no cookies are set before you agree to it. If you want to use 
	the plug-in, simply activate it through the "activate" button. This will load a script, transforming the gray sqaure into the plug-in
	you know with it's full capablities. Be aware that by doing so, the third party can set and request cookies from your browser which can be used 
	to track your activites across all websited that use a plug-in by the same third party. For now, this extension only works on Twitter plug-ins
	because it is only a prototype to experiment with contextual consent.
